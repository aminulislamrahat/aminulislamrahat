# üëã Hi, I'm Md. Aminul Islam Bhuiyan Rahat

I'm a frontend developer with over three years of experience building intuitive and scalable user interfaces, primarily using React.js. My journey into frontend development began with a curiosity for how things work on the web, and quickly evolved into a passion for creating clean, responsive designs that not only function well but feel smooth and engaging for users. 

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a variety of web applications‚Äîfrom simple static sites to complex single-page applications‚Äîfocusing on clean code, component reusability, and accessibility. I‚Äôm particularly confident with JavaScript and React, and I enjoy working with modern tools like Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Git to optimize performance and streamline development workflows. While frontend development is my core focus, I also have a basic understanding of Unity and C#, which has given me a deeper appreciation for interaction design and game mechanics.

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with side projects, and staying updated on frontend trends. I believe in continuous learning and collaboration, and I'm always open to connecting with like-minded developers and teams who value creativity, simplicity, and thoughtful design.

If you're interested in collaborating or just having a conversation about web development, feel free to reach out!
